# spencers.dev

The compiled files necessary for hosting the static website [spencers.dev](https://spencers.dev/)

# Usage

`dist` - contains the built static website
`docs` - contains google drive articles

# Future

In the future I'll upload
* the source files to build this dist
* the script files to automate the entire deployment stack

Also in the future the articles would be natively within the code in some markup language instead of separately via google docs.
